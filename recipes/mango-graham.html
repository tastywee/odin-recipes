    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Filipino mango float is a no bake dessert with layers of cream, mango and graham crackers. The mango float is
        super easy to make but waiting to eat is agony! You will need to refrigerate the dessert overnight to ensure
        that the cream settles and the crackers become soft.
    </p>
    <p>This dessert is perfect for ripe fresh mangoes. I’m not much of a baker myself, so this mango dessert was very
        easy for me to assemble. The filipino mango float also only uses 5 ingredients! It’s light, creamy, and
        perfectly sweet – the perfect dessert for hot summer days.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>heavy cream, chilled overnight</li>
        <li>sweetened condensed milk, chilled overnight</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>ripe mangos</li>
        <li>graham crackers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your mangos are ripe and sweet. Peel the skin and slice mangos thinly or you can chop the mangos.
            Set aside. </li>
        <li>Whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Then gradually add pinch of salt and condensed milk.
            Whip cream until stiff peaks form. Tip: chill the heavy cream, condensed milk, and bowl in the fridge for a few
            hours or overnight for easy whipped cream!</li>
        <li>Crush graham crackers until desired crumb or use the whole cracker without crushing. I like it crushed for a
            soft crumble texture.</li>
        <li>Let’s start layering the mango float in a 8 x 8 inch glass container or a large container. First lay the graham
            crackers. Then, whipped cream. Lastly, add sliced mango. Repeat one more time. For the last layer, add whipped
            cream and sliced mango. You can also add more graham cracker crumbs at the top for decoration.
            </li>
        <li>Cover the container and refrigerate overnight. Served chilled for soft texture (like bread pudding). Another
            option is to freeze overnight for ice cream like texture. Before eating, thaw for 30 minutes or less depending
            on what texture you like.</li>
    </ol>
